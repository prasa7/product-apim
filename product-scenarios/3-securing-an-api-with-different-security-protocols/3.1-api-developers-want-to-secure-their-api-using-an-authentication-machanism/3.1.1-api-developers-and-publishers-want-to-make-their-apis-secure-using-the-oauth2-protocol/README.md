# 3.1.1 Secure an application

## When to use this approach
When an application needs to be secure using the OAuth2 protocol

## Sample use case
API developers and publishers want to make their APIs secure the OAuth2 protocol to enable modern applications (mobiles, IoT devices, etc) to gain secure access to the APIs.

## Supported versions
All

## Pre-requisites
User can use API store and API publisher web application to implement the flow

## Development guidelines
Start wso2am-2.6.0 distribution by executing [APIM_HOME]/bin/wso2server.sh or [APIM_HOME]/bin/wso2server.bat
Then user will need to login to API store. Once logged in, user can invoke the APIs secure using the OAuth2 protocol

## Sample Configuration
No additional configuration or data to be added to servers.

## Deployment guidelines
API Manager 2.6.0 deployment required. No additional artifact or data to be added to servers.
